            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Love uniteth the members of the body each to other. Eph. 2.20.21. &amp; 4.16.3. Col. 3.14.15.</p>
            <p>The outward part of the true forme of the
<pb facs="tcp:93384:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>true viſible church is a vow, promiſe, oath, or covenant betwixt God and the Saints: by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion from the inward forme: ſee alſo Gen. 17.1.2. and 15, 18. Deut. 29.1 9-13.2. Chron. 29.10, &amp; 34.30.32. Pſal. 119.106. Nehem. 9, 38. &amp; 10.29. 1. Cor 12.25.26. Rom. 12, 5.15.16. Mat. 18.15.17.</p>
            <p>This covenant hath 2 parts. 1. reſpecting God and the faithful. 2. reſpecting the faithful mutually. Mat. 18 20.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of the covenant reſpecting God is either from God to the faithful, or from the faithful to God 2. Cor 6, 16</p>
            <p>From God to the faithfull. Mat, 22.3.2. the ſum wherof is expreſſed. 2. Cor. 6.16. I wil be their God.</p>
            <p>To be God to the faithful is 1. to give Chriſt, 2. with Chriſt al things els Eſay 9.6. 1. Tim. 4.8.2. Pet. 1.3. Rom. 8.32. 1. Cor. 3.21-13.</p>
            <p>From the faithful to God 2. Cor. 6.16. the ſumme whereof is to be Gods people, that is to obey al the commandements of God. Deut. 29.9.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the covenant reſpecting the faithful mutually, conteineth all the duties of love whatſoever Levit. 19.17- Mat. 18.15, 16, 1. Theſ. 5.14. Mat. 22.39.2. Theſ, 3, 14.45. Heb. 3.13 &amp; 10, 24 25.</p>
            <p>The true properties of a true Church viſible
<pb facs="tcp:93384:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>are two. I communion in all the holy things of God. 2, the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, 1 Ioh. 1, 5. 1, Cor 10 16 &amp; 5.4.5. Mat, 18.20. Eſay 55, 3 Act 13, 34.</p>
            <p>The holy things of God are 1. Chriſt. 2. bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by Chriſt. Rom, 8.32</p>
            <p>The true Church hath title, poſſeſſion, and uſe of Chriſt. Eſa. 9 6, Song 2 16. Mat. 18.20. 1. Cor. 3 21.23. Eph 5 30</p>
            <p>The benefits which the true Church hath by Chriſt are the meanes of ſalvation and almes, 1 Tim 14 8, 2 Pet. 1, 3.</p>
            <p>The meanes of ſalvation are the word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, prayers. Cenſures, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt for the diſpenſing of them all, Rom. 3, 2, &amp; 4, 11. Luk 19 46, Mat. 18, 15, 17. Act. 2, 42, 1 Cor. 11, 23, 26, Mat. 28, 19, Pſal. 149, 6, 9.</p>
            <p>Almes are the works of mercy yeelded to the Saincts in diſtreſſe. Act. 2, 44, 45, &amp; 5, 4, Mat. 25, 34, 40, Heb. 13, 1, 3, 1 Tim. 3, 2, &amp; 5, 10.</p>

            <p>The cauſe of caſting officers out of office, are
<pb facs="tcp:93384:14"/>apoſtacy or diſability. Ezec. 44, 10. Nom. 8, 23-26.</p>
            <p>Apoſtacy is when the officers shal fall to open Idolatrie, Atheiſme, hereſy, or other ſins equipollent of the firſt or ſecond table: <hi>Ezech.</hi> 44.10, <hi>&amp; by proportion drawne from</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.9 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22.1-5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 21, 16, 24, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2, 61, 62.</p>
            <p>The officer upon repentance after apoſtacy or ſin equipollent therto may be reteyned as a member of the church, but not as an officer. <hi>Eze</hi> 44, 13, 14, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 69-75. <hi>compared with Iohn</hi> 21, 15-18. <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 38. Quaere</p>
            <p>Diſabilitie is eyther of age, or ſicknes, or mayming, &amp;c</p>
            <p>Diſabilitie of age is when the officer can no longer by reaſon of old age diſcharged the works of his office: then he may reteyn his dignity &amp; ought to be honored of all, <hi>Num.</hi> 8, 23,-26. <hi>Philemon</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Diſability by ſicknes, as frenzie, Madnes, Melancholie, or by mayming as loſſe of the tong in the paſtor or teacher &amp;c. or by any other infirmitie diſabling him to the actions of his office, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16-24, <hi>compared with</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 2, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 6, 9, Quaere, Whither an officer may refuſe an office impoſed upon him by a lawfull calling. <hi>Exod,</hi> 4, 14, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1.6, 7, 17.</p>
            <p>Quaere, Wether the church may ſuffer her officer to be tranſlated from her ſelf to other
<pb facs="tcp:93384:14"/>churches upon any ground, <hi>Act.</hi> 20, 28, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5 2, <hi>Act</hi> 13.4. yea though it be granted that she have members as fit for offices as her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are in preſent? yea though the life of the officer be endaungered, <hi>Act.</hi> 9, 25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 23 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18 4.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of caſting members out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is only one: viz. ſin obſtinately ſtood in without repentance and confeſſion after due conviction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 17. <hi>Iob</hi> 31, 33. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28, 13.</p>
            <p>Due conviction is the diſcovery of the ſinne by manifeſt evidence, <hi>Iob.</hi> 19, 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 32.12.13, <hi>&amp;</hi> 39, 37.</p>
            <p>Manifeſt evidence is either to the fact, or ſinfulnes of the fact.</p>
            <p>The fact is evident either by confeſſion of the partie that committed the fact: or by ſufficient witneſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.65. <hi>Deut</hi> 19, 15, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 31.</p>
            <p>Quaere, whether the teſtimony of them that are without, is ſufficient or no.</p>
            <p>The ſinfulneſſe of the fact is evident either by direct Scripture, or by neceſſary conſequence from the ſcripture. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22, 31, 32, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4, 4.</p>
            <p>Due conviction is perceived two wayes, firſt by the delinquents shifting, cavils, excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, tergiverſations &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.6, <hi>Tit,</hi> 3, 11, Secondly by the conſcience of them that have power to cenſure the fact. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36, 1, <hi>Prov,</hi> 17, 19. <hi>Tit,</hi> 3, 10. 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 2, 15 <hi>&amp;</hi> 12, 10.</p>
            <p>Obſtinacy in ſin is the refuſing of confeſſing
<pb facs="tcp:93384:15"/>and forſaking the crime. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 17. <hi>Ioth.</hi> 7, 1, 9.</p>
            <p>If the matter be not evident, but doubtfull and controverſall, communion ſtill muſt be preſerved peaceably, notwithſtanding diverſity of iudgement, till the trueth be diſcovered. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 15 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.49.7.9.</p>
            <p>Perſons that differ in iudgement are either ſtrong or weake. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1</p>
            <p>The ſtrong muſt not maintaine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with the weake, nor deſpiſe them, but beare their infirmitie and burden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1, 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6, 2. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13, 5, 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9, 22, <hi>&amp;</hi> 10, 23.34.</p>
            <p>The weak muſt not cenſure or judg the ſtrong as delinquents, but meekly deſire inſtruction and ſatisfaction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 1-3.</p>
            <p>Thus muſt men walke in diverſity of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during which time, all men muſt carefully ſearch out the trueth, &amp; labour for informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>The power given the Church for caſting out obſtinate convicted offenders is the power of excommunication. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18.3 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1, 5, 4, 5, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 12, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3, 6, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.</p>
            <p>Quaere, whether delivering to Satan be not, or conteine ſome bodily punishment inflicted upon the offender. ſee. <hi>Act.</hi> 5, 5, 10, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93384:15"/>
            <p>Excommunication is the depriving of the offender of the viſible communion of Saints, and the benefit of the holy things of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5, 11, 13.2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3, 6, 14. Mat. 18.17.</p>
            <p>Quaere, Whether ſeparating, withdrawing, turning away from falſe teachers and wicked liver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, be the ſame with excommunication, 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 3, 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>and</hi> 2, 3, 5. <hi>Mat</hi> 18, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Excommunication duely adminiſtred is ratified and confirmed in heaven. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Iob.</hi> 20.23.</p>
            <p>Therefore the partie excommunicate is in the hands of Sathan, and out of the Lords protection and bleſſing, being deprived of all the publicke meanes of ſalvation. Mat. 18, 17. Cor. 5.5. Eſay 4.5, 6.</p>
            <p>In excommunication conſider two things: firſt the decreing of it, which muſt be done by the whole church. 1 Cor. 5 4, wherein the church muſt proceed as in approving her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Secondly the pronouncing of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication which muſt be performed by the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perſon deputed thereto by the Church. 1. Cor. 14, 40.</p>
            <p>The end of excommunication is not the deſtruction of the offender, but the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſinne, and the ſalvation of his ſoule 1 Cor. 5.5.2. Theſ. 3.14.15. 1 Tim. 1, 23,</p>
            <p>The partie excommunicate is not to be
<pb facs="tcp:93384:16"/>counted as an enemy, but to be admonished as a brother, 2. Theſſ. 5.15. Quaere,</p>
            <p>The members of the church are to avoid all religious and civil communion with him that is excommunicate, Mat, 18.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 1 Cor 5, 11, except that ſubjects, ſervants, children, parents, wiſe or husband &amp;c. that are bound to him may performe civil and naturall offices to him. 1. Cor. 7 5, 12.13, and by proportion.</p>
            <p>The partie excommunicate upon repentance is to be admitted againe into the communion of the viſible Church. 2 Cor. 2.6-8. yet ſo as that the Church alwayes have an eſpeciall eye to him, as being a ſuſpitious perſon that durſt deſpiſe the Church, Mat. 18.17. Ezech. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, 10. 2 Pet. 2.22. Heb. 10.26. by proportion.</p>
            <p>Quaere, Whether an officer excommunicate, upon repentance may be again admitted into office: &amp; whether muſt he have new vocation by election approbation, ordination yea or nay?</p>
            <p>The viſible Church walking in this holy order hath in it the preſence and protection of Chriſt. Eſa. 4.5.6. Mat 28 20. &amp; 18.20.</p>
            <p>To this viſible Church muſt al ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſort that deſire to be ſaved. Act. 4, 12. Mat. 7.13.14. Ioh 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.6.</p>
            <p>True viſible churches are of two ſorts: firſt pure where no open known ſinne is ſuffred. Rev. 2.7-13. &amp; 3.8-11. ſecond corrupt, wherein ſome one or more open knowne ſin is
<pb facs="tcp:93384:16"/>tolerated. Rev. 3.1.6. 1 Cor. 11.17.21.22.</p>
            <p>True viſible Churches are ſo far forth good as they agree to the paterne of the word: Heb. 8.5. Rev. cap. 2. &amp; 3.1 Cor. 1, 2, 17.22.</p>
            <p>Every true viſible Church hath title to whole Chriſt and al the holy things of God. Eſa. 9.6, 7. Song. 2.16. Ephe. 1.22.23.</p>
            <p>Every true viſible Church is of equal power with all other viſible Churches. <hi>Apoc. cap.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. 1. Cor. 5. and hath power to reforme al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes within it ſelf 1 Cor. 11.2.17. which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſpirituall as is Chriſts kingdom not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bodily, nor carnal, Ioh. 18, 36, 2 Cor. 10, 3.5.</p>
            <p>The erecting of viſible churches apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth to princes and private perſons.</p>
            <p>Princes muſt erect them in their dominions &amp; command all their ſubjects to enter into them, being firſt prepared and fitted thereto. 2. Chron. 29. &amp; 34. and 17.</p>
            <p>Private perſons ſeparating from all ſinne, and joyning together to obey Chriſt their king, prieſt and prophet, as they are bound, are a true viſible Church, &amp; have a Charter given them of Chriſt thereto, being but two or three. Mat. 18, 20. Act. 14, 19, 20. Heb. 11.38. and further powre then to reforme themſelves they have none.</p>
            <p>Every man is bound in conſcience to be a member of ſome viſible church eſtablished into this true order. Mat. 7.13. Rev. 18.4.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93384:17"/>
            <p>Becauſe every man is bound to obey Chriſt in his kingdome and ſpiritual regiment and no other <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 14, 27 and the true viſible church is Chriſts kingdome and houſe <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. <hi>with Luk</hi> 19, 14.27, <hi>Act.</hi> 1, 3. <hi>Heb</hi> 12, 28, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3, 6,</p>
            <p>Therfore they that are not members of this viſible church, are no ſubjects of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.17, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p>This true viſible church is called Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the true church: the falſe church of Antichriſt followeth to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever thing is contrarie to this order of the viſible church is Antichriſtian, by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word compared with 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever taketh upon him to erect new forme or shappes of viſible churches, and to appoint new officers, lawes, miniſterie, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or communion in the church is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4 3. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4 <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.16.17.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever yeeldeth or ſubmitteth to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitution, lawes, officers, miniſtery or worship then that of Chriſts appoyntement is the ſubjecte, ſervant of Antichriſt, by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from the former. <hi>&amp; Rom.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p>A man cannot be both the ſervant of Chriſt and of Antichriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 24.</p>
